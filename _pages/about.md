I am a second-year PhD student at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger).
While I mainly focus on AI alignment, my interests also extend to understanding the workings of machine learning and the broader implications of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Prior to joining ETH, I worked at the fast-growing startup [Neural Concept](https://www.neuralconcept.com) as a technical project manager, 
where we applied geometric deep learning to solve real-world engineering problems.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering and a Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering, both from EPFL. For the more curious, please find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
